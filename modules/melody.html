<h2>Melody</h2>
<h3>Melody is Topological</h3>
<p>
	Topology is the branch of geometry that studies properties that are preserved after stretching, twisting, folding, and otherwise deforming a shape. Imagine taking a deflated beach ball and crumpling it into every conceivable shape of deflated beach ball; all these shapes would be topologically equivalent. The only rule is that you aren't permitted to cut or tear the beach ball. A plate and a bowl are topologically equivalent, because you can get a bowl from a plate by folding up the edges. 
</p>
<p>
	Two shapes are topologically equivalent if points that are nearby in the first are also nearby in the second; there hasn't been some fissure that would separate two neighboring points.

<h3>Melody is a series of vectors</h3>
