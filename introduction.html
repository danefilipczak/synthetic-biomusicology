<h2>Synthetic Biomusicology</h2>
<p>
	This book is an experiment in expressing the theory of music from the body on outward. 
</p>
<p>
	There are three parts:
	<ul>
		<li>Practice</li>
		<li>Theory</li>
		<li>Generation</li>
	</ul>
	Part one outlines a technique of music composition that takes as its starting place biology and the reality of the body. It doesn't assume prior familiarity with music theory, but one may find themself behooved by the ability to read standard music notation.
</p>
	
<p>
	Part two addresses some philosophical and practical concerns raised by part one. 
</p>
<p>
	Part three extends part one into the computational domain, describing and speculating about techniques for generating music computationally that are informed by an embodied understanding of the way in which music affects us.
